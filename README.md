# GroceryListManager

This my Java program I made for my class final. It help me not forget my grocery stuff.  
I always write list on paper and lose it so I make this to keep my list safe on computer.  
In this program I can add new grocery items, remove what I don’t want no more, and see my whole list anytime.  
I made it in Visual Studio Code and tested it many times.  

I put comments in my code so anybody can read what it do even if they don’t know Java.  
When I run it, it show me menu with 4 choices: Add, Remove, View, Exit.  
It keep asking until I say Exit. It use Scanner to get what I type and ArrayList to save my items.

This help me learn about loops, if else, and input.  
I put it here on GitHub so my teacher can see my full code and check it work good.
